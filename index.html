<h2>About</h2>
<p>The pandemic has brought out the best and worst in people. For me, this has included wearing the same chenille lounge pants for a week straight (very comfortable, highly recommend), worrying about the future, and learning to code.
<br><br>
I was one of those millennial kids who stayed up until 2AM on a school night perfecting my myspace layout, scrapping the original styles and creating a whole new web page. I didn't even realize it but I was learning basic HTML and CSS.
<br><br>
Over the past couple of years I had been thinking about really learning how to code but I always had excuses, not enough time being at the top of the list. Now I, like a lot of people, have found myself with an abundance of time. So I finally mustered up the courage, ignored the imposter syndrome, and learned the basics. I now have a good foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and I am currently building a portfolio which you can view below.
<br><br>
I really enjoy front end web development and design because it requires a level of logic, problem solving, and creativity. After learning Javascript and building my first full website I am also interested in learning some backend languages to give my websites more functionality. I would love to be in the position of having a mentor. Someone I can just ask a question on the rare occasion when the results on Stack Overflow aren't cutting it and who can provide me with some real constructive criticism.
<br><br>
I live in Milwaukee, WI with my partner and two cats. I love to travel and travel often, no vacation days are wasted. I love trying new restaurants and exploring different cuisines. I like listening to lo-fi pop/rock, and going to shows (clearly the pandemic has done a number on my interests). I also enjoy cooking extravagant meals that take a whole day to prepare and sharing them with my family and friends. </p>
